Pick at least 5 use cases and provide example "implementations" of them, using only methods from your code interfaces. 
Note, these should be separate Java code files in the folder doc/usecases that compile and contain extensive comments 
explaining how you expect your different APIs to collaborate. Note, you can implement each feature either in a single 
class to show how the steps are connected "procedurally" or in separate classes that implement the necessary interfaces 
to show how the steps are "distributed" across the objects. In either case, you will likely need to create simple 
"mocked up" objects that implement your interfaces so you have something concrete to create, using new, and call 
methods on.
