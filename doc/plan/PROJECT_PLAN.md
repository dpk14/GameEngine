PROJECT PLAN
===
Write your project plan in a single file, PROJECT_PLAN.md, that describes the program modules each team member plans to 
take primary and secondary responsibility for and a high-level plan of how the team will spend its time to complete the 
program. Specifically, each person should take responsibility for specific features and use cases they intend to work on
during the first sprint (core features) and during the second sprint (extensions). This requires the team to agree on 
the feature priorities and set a goal for what to show at the midpoint demo.

## High-level plan for how team will spend its time to complete the program:
